===============

A Spray.io and Angular.js application for the San Antonio Java Users Group to do cool things with stuff. And maybe be useful.

## ToDo list
Minimum viable product (look at me use buzzwords):

 - [ ] Create Spray.io app, possibly that can run in google app engine, or maybe heroku
 - [ ] The two necessary questions are:
  * How did you like this JUG meeting overall?
  * How likely are you to recommend the JUG to a friend based on this meeting?
  * 1-5 scale on each one or maybe use -2 to +2
 - [ ] Build an angular.js ui for the backend and frontend

### Fun things
 - [ ] Check in to the jug -- Needs to work mobile
 - [ ] Raffle program based on who was there
 - [ ] Easy way to add a new entry, possibly description and links to items of interest
 - [ ] Automatic mailing of the survey, based on who checked in
 - [ ] A way to watch the raffle results from your phone
 - [ ] Push notification to a mobile app if you won
